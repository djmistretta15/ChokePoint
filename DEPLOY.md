# ⚡ TOLLBOOTH SEEKER AI - READY TO DEPLOY!

## ✅ What's Included

Your complete infrastructure intelligence system with 8 files:

### Core Engine (Python)
- `main.py` - Main orchestrator
- `signal_detector.py` - Multi-source signal detection
- `database.py` - SQLite signal tracking

### Configuration
- `config.json` - All settings (edit this!)
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Full technical guide
- `QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference
- `start.sh` - One-click startup script

### Directories
- `logs/` - Will contain tollbooth_seeker.log
- `data/` - Will contain signals.db

---

## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd tollbooth-seeker
pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
```

### Step 2: Review Settings (Optional)
Open `config.json` to customize:
- Scan interval (default: 60 minutes)
- Minimum signal score (default: 7.0)
- Enable/disable sources
- Sector weights

### Step 3: Launch!
```bash
./start.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

---

## 📊 What Happens Next

The engine will:

1. ✅ Create SQLite database at `data/signals.db`
2. ✅ Start scanning HackerNews, GitHub, Reddit, ArXiv
3. ✅ Display dashboard metrics
4. ✅ Detect infrastructure chokepoint signals
5. ✅ Calculate inevitability, moat, and timing scores
6. ✅ Save qualified signals (score >= 7.0)
7. ✅ Auto-watchlist high-priority signals (score >= 8.5)
8. ✅ Repeat every hour

---

## 🎯 First Run Expectations

### During First Cycle (2-3 minutes)
- Scanning all sources
- "No signals detected" is normal if feeds are quiet
- Database initializing

### After First Hour
- 5-15 signals detected (typical)
- Mix of sectors
- 1-3 high-priority signals
- Dashboard populated

### After 24 Hours
- 20-50 signals
- Clear sector patterns
- Growing watchlist
- Trend visibility

---

## 🎓 Understanding Your Data

### The Dashboard Shows
```
Active Signals: 23      ← Total signals tracked
Average Score: 7.8      ← Quality indicator
High Priority: 5        ← Score 8.5+
Hidden Gems: 12         ← Score 7.5-8.4
New (24h): 8           ← Recently detected
```

### Signal Scores Mean
- **9.0+**: Exceptional opportunity - research NOW
- **8.5-8.9**: High priority - strong signal
- **7.5-8.4**: Hidden gem - monitor
- **7.0-7.4**: Qualified - periodic check
- **<7.0**: Filtered out (not saved)

---

## 💡 Quick Wins

### See Results Immediately
Even on first run, if HackerNews/Reddit are active, you'll see signals within minutes.

### Interactive Mode
Start the engine and choose option 2-4 to explore existing data without running detection.

### Watch the Logs
```bash
tail -f logs/tollbooth_seeker.log
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Tips

### Want More Signals?
```json
"min_signal_score": 6.5  // Lower threshold
```

### Want Faster Detection?
```json
"scan_interval_minutes": 30  // More frequent scans
```

### Focus on AI Only?
Increase AI sector weight:
```json
"AI": { "weight": 1.5 }
```

### Enable Twitter (if you have API key)
```json
"twitter": {
  "enabled": true,
  "api_key": "your-key-here"
}
```

## 🛑 How to Stop

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

The engine will:
- Display final summary
- Show top signals
- Show sector breakdown
- Save everything to database
- Exit cleanly

## 📈 What to Do With Your Data

### For Investors
1. Review high-priority signals daily
2. Research early movers
3. Track sector trends
4. Build investment thesis

### For Founders
1. Find gaps in infrastructure
2. Validate market pain
3. Identify competitors
4. Time market entry

### For Researchers
1. Monitor academic → commercial transitions
2. Track adoption patterns
3. Find collaboration opportunities

## 🔍 Exploring Your Database

```python
from database import SignalDatabase

db = SignalDatabase()

# Top 20 signals by score
top = db.get_active_signals(20)

# High-priority only
priority = db.get_high_priority_signals(8.5)

# AI signals only
ai = db.get_signals_by_sector('AI')

# Sector statistics
stats = db.get_sector_stats()

# Dashboard overview
dashboard = db.get_dashboard_stats()

# Your watchlist
watchlist = db.get_watchlist()
```

---

## 🚨 Common First-Run Issues

### "No signals detected"
- **Normal if**: Feeds are quiet at that hour
- **Try**: Run for a few cycles, lower min_signal_score
- **Check**: Internet connection, source availability

### "Database locked"
- **Cause**: Another program accessing the DB
- **Fix**: Close other programs, restart engine

### "Permission denied"
- **Cause**: Can't write to logs/ or data/
- **Fix**: `chmod -R 755 tollbooth-seeker/`

---

## 📊 Expected Performance

### Sources Scanned Per Cycle
- HackerNews: ~30 top stories
- GitHub: ~30 trending repos
- Reddit: ~100 posts across subreddits
- ArXiv: ~60 recent papers

### Detection Rate
- **Active tech news day**: 10-20 signals/hour
- **Quiet day**: 3-5 signals/hour
- **Weekly average**: ~150-300 signals

### Quality
- ~30% score 7.0-7.4 (qualified)
- ~50% score 7.5-8.4 (hidden gems)
- ~15% score 8.5-8.9 (high priority)
- ~5% score 9.0+ (exceptional)
