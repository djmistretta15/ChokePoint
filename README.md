# ‚ö° Tollbooth Seeker AI

**Infrastructure Chokepoint Intelligence Engine - Detecting Tomorrow's Mandatory Rails**

---

## üéØ What It Does

Tollbooth Seeker AI automatically identifies emerging infrastructure that will become **mandatory chokepoints** - places where everyone will eventually need to pay a "toll."

Think: Stripe for payments, AWS for cloud, OpenAI for AI - infrastructure that becomes unavoidable.

The system monitors multiple sources (HackerNews, GitHub, Reddit, ArXiv) to detect:
- **API complaints** ‚Üí "We need unified access to X"
- **Integration pain** ‚Üí "Too many fragmented services"
- **Adoption signals** ‚Üí "Everyone is using X"
- **VC funding** ‚Üí "Series A for infrastructure startup"
- **Moat indicators** ‚Üí "Network effects" + "switching costs"

---

## üèÜ Core Concept

### The Three Scores

Every detected signal gets three scores (0-100):

1. **Inevitability** (40% weight)
   - Will this become mandatory infrastructure?
   - Are people already frustrated by fragmentation?
   - Is there industry adoption momentum?

2. **Moat Potential** (35% weight)
   - Can the eventual winner build defensibility?
   - Network effects? Switching costs? Data advantage?
   - Are protocols/standards forming?

3. **Timing Window** (25% weight)
   - How early are we?
   - Is it emerging or already mature?
   - What's the investment window?

### Composite Score

Final score = (Inevitability √ó 0.4) + (Moat √ó 0.35) + (Timing √ó 0.25) √ó 10

**Score interpretation:**
- **9.0+**: Exceptional opportunity - investigate immediately
- **8.5-8.9**: High priority - strong signal
- **7.5-8.4**: Hidden gem - monitor closely
- **7.0-7.4**: Qualified signal - periodic check
- **<7.0**: Filtered out

---

## üìä Dashboard Metrics

When running, you'll see:

- **Active Signals**: Total number being tracked
- **Average Score**: Overall signal quality
- **High Priority**: Signals scoring 8.5+
- **Hidden Gems**: Solid signals (7.5-8.4) with less visibility
- **New (24h)**: Signals detected in last 24 hours

---

## üö¶ Toll Mechanisms

The system identifies likely toll collection methods:

1. **API** - Per-request fees, premium caching, SLA guarantees
   - Examples: Stripe, Twilio, OpenAI

2. **Network** - Transaction fees, bandwidth costs
   - Examples: Ethereum, AWS, Cloudflare

3. **Data** - Access fees, storage costs, query charges
   - Examples: Snowflake, MongoDB Atlas, Databricks

4. **Platform** - Platform fees, revenue share, subscriptions
   - Examples: Shopify, Unity, Roblox

5. **Protocol** - Usage fees, governance tokens, staking
   - Examples: Uniswap, IPFS, The Graph

## üîß Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize:

### Scoring Weights
```json
"scoring_weights": {
  "inevitability": 0.4,      // How mandatory will it become?
  "moat_potential": 0.35,    // Can winners build defensibility?
  "timing_window": 0.25      // How early are we?
}
```

### Thresholds
```json
"min_signal_score": 7.0,           // Minimum score to save
"high_priority_threshold": 8.5     // Auto-watchlist above this
```

### Scan Settings
```json
"scan_interval_minutes": 60        // How often to check sources
```

### Enable/Disable Sources
```json
"signal_sources": {
  "hackernews": { "enabled": true },
  "github": { "enabled": true },
  "reddit": { "enabled": true },
  "arxiv": { "enabled": true },
  "twitter": { "enabled": false }   // Requires API key
}
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
```

### Run the Engine
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Or use the startup script
```bash
./start.sh
```

---

## üìã What Happens When Running

The engine will:

1. ‚úÖ Scan HackerNews, GitHub, Reddit, ArXiv every hour
2. ‚úÖ Detect infrastructure-related discussions
3. ‚úÖ Extract breadcrumbs (pain points, adoption signals)
4. ‚úÖ Calculate three-part scores
5. ‚úÖ Save signals scoring 7.0+ to database
6. ‚úÖ Auto-watchlist signals scoring 8.5+
7. ‚úÖ Display dashboard metrics
8. ‚úÖ Show new high-priority opportunities

---

## üìä Viewing Results

### While Running
The terminal displays:
- Dashboard stats
- New signals detected
- Scores and classifications
- Breadcrumbs that triggered detection

### Interactive Menu
When starting, you can choose:
1. Start detection cycle (continuous)
2. View top signals (current database)
3. View sector breakdown
4. View watchlist

### Database Queries

```python
from database import SignalDatabase

db = SignalDatabase()

# Get top 20 signals
signals = db.get_active_signals(20)

# Get high-priority signals
priority = db.get_high_priority_signals(8.5)

# Get signals by sector
ai_signals = db.get_signals_by_sector('AI')

# Get sector statistics
stats = db.get_sector_stats()

# Get dashboard overview
dashboard = db.get_dashboard_stats()
```

---

## üéØ Example Signals

### High-Priority Signal (9.2/10)
```
Multi-Agent API Orchestration Layer

Breadcrumbs:
‚Ä¢ API complaints: "rate limit"
‚Ä¢ Integration pain: "multiple APIs"
‚Ä¢ Adoption signals: "becoming standard"
‚Ä¢ VC funding: "Series A"

Inevitability: 95%
Moat Potential: 85%
Timing Window: 90%

Toll Mechanism: API (per-request routing, premium caching)
Early Movers: LangChain, AutoGPT, MemGPT
```

### What This Means
There's growing pain around managing multiple AI APIs. Someone will build a unified orchestration layer. Early adopters are experimenting. The eventual winner will charge per-request routing fees. **This is investable now.**

## üö® Important Notes

### This is Intelligence, Not Advice

Tollbooth Seeker identifies **potential** infrastructure chokepoints. Always:
- Do your own research
- Validate market size
- Assess competition
- Check feasibility
- Consider timing

### False Positives

Not every signal becomes a tollbooth:
- Markets may be too small
- Incumbents may solve the problem
- Technology may change
- Timing may be wrong

**Use signals as starting points for deeper research.**
